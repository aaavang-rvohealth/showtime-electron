          <Text>Showtime is a streamlined app designed specifically for dancers, making it easy to organize, manage, and
            play music for performances and rehearsals. It allows dancers to create playlists, arrange music tracks for
            specific routines, and set cues for seamless transitions. With simple playback controls and the ability to save
            different sets, Showtime helps performers stay focused on their dance while effortlessly managing their music.
            Whether for soloists, groups, or instructors, Showtime brings a professional touch to every show, rehearsal, and
            routine.</Text>
